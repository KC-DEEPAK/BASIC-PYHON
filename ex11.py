#BITWISE OPERATOR [&,|,^,~,<<,>>]
a=4
b=5
print(a&b)# in this 4 binary value is 0100 and 5 binary value is 0101 ans is 0100 is 4 ans and operation
print(a|b)#in this operation the value of 0100 and 0101 ans is 5
# BITWISE XOR(^) in this condition both as to be diffrent bit eg 0 and 1=1
print(a^b)# in this we have a 0100 and 0101 are there and xor is 0001 is 1 in decimal
#COMPLIMENT(~)
print(~a)# we are geting a -5 why when we done a complement of 4(0100) its compliment is 1010 is -5
#LIFT SHIFT AND RIGHT SHIFT
r=4
print(r<<2)#we can seen that 4 in binary(0100) by shifting by two bit we got(010000)no disgrad the element
print(r>>2)# hear we can remove the two bits and add two zeros to the 4(0100)->(0001)we got 1
#ASSINGMENT
t,g=26,23
print(t&g)
