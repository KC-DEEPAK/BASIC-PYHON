#IDENTITY OPERATOR,we have a two types are is and isnot.
a=5
b=5
print(a is b)#its says true because of a also int and b also int and both are stored in the one memory location.
c=6
d='6'
print(c is d)#we got a false becaues of c is int and d is in string and it create a new memory location.
#ISNOT CONDISION
e=7
f=8
print(e is not f)#its true because of yes e is not a f its diffrent.
#WE CAN USE ID OF THE MEMORY LOCATION .
g=6
h=7
print(id(g))
print(id(h))
print(g is h)
#ASSINGMENT
t=5
print(id(t))
t=5
print(id(t))
print(t is t)
THANKS
